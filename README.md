# 01_CodeRefactor

Code Refactoring for Horiseon Social Solution Services, Inc.

DESCRIPTION
The goal of this project was to review and refactor the code for Horiseon's homepage with an emphasis on following proper accessibility standards. 

The first change I made was to implement proper semantic html tags to improve the accessability of the page. I broke it down into the header, two body sections, and a footer. I broke each section into 3 articles by related content & images. Then I adjusted the style.css file to align the classes with the new semantic html. I also consolidated duplicate classes that had identically styling into a single class that could be applied multiple times in the html. I have included comments to the index.html & style.css files explaining what the code does and why it's necessary.
